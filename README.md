# 🌍 My Recent Trip to Greece – Travel Blog Web Page

This is a simple static webpage created using HTML and CSS that documents my recent trip to Greece. It is designed as a clean, beginner-friendly project that shares key highlights of the country, places I visited, and a detailed itinerary – all wrapped in a responsive layout.

## ✨ About the Project

This project was created as part of my learning journey in **web development and open source culture**. It's a personal experiment to build and share something publicly using basic HTML and CSS – no frameworks, no JavaScript – just pure structure and style.

I learned to:
- Structure a webpage using semantic HTML
- Style it cleanly using internal CSS
- Create tables, lists, links, and image layouts
- Use Git and GitHub to host and share my work
- Understand what it means to contribute something openly

## 💡 Why Open Source?

I recently explored **Git, GitHub, and open source** through this small project. Hosting this page publicly helped me:
- Understand how version control works
- Contribute to the open web
- Get a taste of how open source projects are structured
- Feel part of a larger developer community

This simple travel blog is not just a static page — it’s my **first step into open source development** and public project hosting.
